# Understanding Privacy Advocates

The following list is a set of recommended readings and viewings that can help participants understand the position of privacy advocates when they object to the current state of advertising technology. The goal of this document is not to be a comprehensive set of all such possible readings or to claim to represent all privacy advocates, instead it aims to help participants understand a broad overview of concerns and potential societal impacts.

This is not required reading, but where we discuss proposals intended to enhance user privacy it helps to understand what issues user advocates bring forward, not just as a set of engineering requirements, but as a set of concerns, fears, and actual observed harms. The intended outcome is to represent privacy advocates who are metaphorical gorillas in the standards discussion room, concerns we attempt to work in awareness of but are not often represented by the concerned parties because of the technical nature of our discussions. The categories are ordered on theoretical accessibility to our participants. Ordering is not intended to denote importance. 

Please make additions to this list at the bottom of the appropriate section.
