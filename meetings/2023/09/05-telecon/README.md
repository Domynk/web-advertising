is for you. The session is targeted at business managers, lawyers, and
engineers involved in standards settings. The presentation will be recorded
and last 40 minutes. Some voluntary audience participation will be
encouraged.

The following Q&A session will not be recorded as per the established
practice of the IWA BG.

Presenters:

Tim Cowen is Chair of the Antitrust Practice at Preiskel&Co and is
independently recognised as one of the leading competition/regulatory
lawyers in the EU. He leads the competition law team at Preiskel&Co where
his practice covers a full range of competition law and regulatory matters
arising across the Tech, Media and Telecoms sector. Tim led BT’s
competition law and public policy team for many years. He led the team
advocating liberalisation of the EU market and the system of law that
promotes competition among telecommunication and technology companies. From
a deep understanding of the reasons for the law he now spends about half of
his time on policy and the reasons either for reform or reinforcement of
the system. In this regard he co-chairs the Digital Policy Alliance
Competition Group with Lord Clement Jones.

Tim has dealt with many abuse of dominance cases and anti-competitive
practices both for
defendants and plaintiffs. For example, in 2009 he left BT to join Sidley
Austin and help Microsoft with deal with the EU commission and compliance
with the Commission and Court decisions. He currently represents a range of
companies in the EU Commission’s ongoing investigations of Google’s abuse
of dominance in online search and the bundling of applications with the
Android operating system; for which the Commission has imposed record
fines. He has dealt with almost every type of case in telecoms and
competition law – advising on the application of the law and leading
transactions and litigation. For example, he has acted on all major merger
cases affecting the sector – either for parties to transactions or third
parties affected by them. Recent cases include Tobii / Smartbox,
TCB/Quidco, as well as representing players in the leading cases such as
WhatsApp/Facebook and Google/DoubleClick, AT&T/ T Mobile, BT/EE and
H3G/O2. Current and past positions include: Founder of Movement for an
Open Web, and the Open Computing Alliance, Board Member of the
International Institute of Communications, Board Member Bingham Centre for
the Rule of Law, Founder member Competition Law Forum British Institute of
International and Comparative Law, Chairman, Armitt Museum, Past Member of
the Competition
Appeal Tribunal, Past Chairman, Competition Panel, Confederation of British
Industry and Past Chairman, International Association of Commercial and
Contract Management. He was awarded the title of ‘Distinguished Visiting
Fellow’ at the European Business School in London and is currently a guest
lecturer for the law faculty at Oxford. He was appointed as a Visiting
Professor at the City of London Law School, and has lectured at Imperial
and Queen Mary Colleges in London. He is a Barrister and holds an MA
(Cantab) in law.


James Rosewell is CEO of 51Degrees, a B2B (aka third-party) data,
opensource, and service provider. He combines 31 years of experience in
business, law, and engineering to solve complex problems. Together with Tim
he founded Movement for an Open Web.

[Presentation](20230905 W3C Standards and Competition.pdf)

DM: introduction and disclaimer that w3c does not provide legal advice. W3C does
not provide legal advice and has not endorsed any of the content that may be
discussed.

JR: Outline of agenda.

Situation find ourselves in today that led to the founding of MOW described.
Gatekeeper platforms creating narrative contrary to the law. Regulators had only
a partial understanding of this. Standard bodies dominated by a small number of
players.

MOW has three spheres of influence. 1) raising awareness through media 2)
working with regulators 3) monitoring standards bodies.

Goals - ensuring access and interoperability, ensuring standards bodies are
governed by fair play and overseen by regulators, protecting choice and
competition.

TC: introduction - external counsel to MOW at Preiskel.

Key competition points relevant to attendees of standards meetings: covers
general prohibitions, economic context, guidance issued by the authorities.

**General prohibitions -** prohibition on anticompetitive agreements and abuses
of a dominant position. Common to the EU, UK and 100 jurisdictions worldwide
(including Russia and China). Important to world trade and liberalisation of
global markets. Agreement fundamental to globalised economic activity. Antitrust
issues particularly within the digital economy discussed in G7 quarterly
meetings. Collaboration and coordination across jurisdictions essential for
effective compliance.

Offences include civil and criminal laws and sanctions.

There has been a recent focus on digital markets. Professor Jason Furman
identified a fall in entry rate and a consequent fall in innovation.
Particularly in the digital economy there is a tendency towards oligopoly, which
is especially important as the nexus between the consumer and a number of
indirectly affected industries and markets. Digital economies tend towards
concentration as they can supply their products more cheaply as they grow in
scale.

Outlines Furman’s 2019 report and evidence given to the House of Commons in
2023\. Furman expressed worry that artificial intelligence due to its requirement
of vast swathes of data will likely fall into the hands of existing entrenched
platforms. This will hurt competition and innovation. Furman concludes that
digital markets will only work effectively if they are properly regulated and
standards are not taken into account.

To conclude standards bodies are important as a matter of not only law but
policy.

**Authority guidance –** must be vigilant primarily about the emergence of
cartels and anticompeittive agreements.

**Standards setting:** often viewed as generally pro competitive, but not if
they only benefit a small few or hurt rivals. Authorities are generally vigilant
to ensure this is not the case. Where companies which engage at the same level
of competition engage together in standards bodies there could be a horizontal
competition issue.

Standards are governed by unrestricted participation and open membership to
lessen anti competitive risks.

Points to examples in EU and US case law.

Objective and nondiscriminatory procedures and voting rights. Example - Apple
manipulated procedure in developing the X standard by stacking the voting in the
development of the nano sim. The standard must be proven to be objectively the
most suited for all. Procedures have to be open and transparent - information on
voting and development must be freely available at every stage of the process.

All relates to avoiding the imposition of the will of a small number on the
marketplace.

To ensure compliance standard to do a risk assessment and risk mitigation
procedure along the lines of the advice outlined. Liability can be created for
the members as well as the organisation if a robust compliance procedure is not
followed.

**Conclusions:** antitrust applies to horizontal relationships. When dealing
with companies with market power, coordination is potentially anti-competitive.
There is a process risk that can be easily avoided by being open and objective.
Guidance and guidelines are extensive and there is a lot of material to ensure
organisations are compliant. TC expresses that would be happy to discuss
compliance with W3C members or management.

JR: introduces poll.

Q: Let’s agree that the price for this product should be 100k per unit?

TC: uncontroversially price fixing.

Q: We need to limit this implementation to major providers ABC?

TC: W3C implementation should be open for all. If set up so that can only be
implemented by ABC would be problematic as would remove opportunity for others
to engage in the standard. If ABC were major market players could be a massive
problem.

Situation: a new proposal has begun which is opposed by dominant players,
dominant players agree to interfere with the development of said standard.

TC: problematic. Especially if dominant platforms involved could be incitement
to impair the proper development of the standard in question.

Situation 2: cookies can be used to harm people, we must remove only third-party
cookies.

TC: Looked at cookies for some time. Realised that cookies were invented to
provide an important function for e commerce and to maintain sessions across the
web - why used by pretty much all. Distinction doesn’t make sense. All cookies
can be used to harm users, to remove just one form does not make sense.

In Lloyd v Google, privacy activist lost as Google ran the argument that their
placement of third party cookies was not necessarily harmful as cookies are just
data files.

There is more likely to arise a privacy issue from yse of first party cookies
than third parties but in general there is no basis for singling out one type of
data processing.

**Practical advice:**

TC: If involved in a meeting where anti-competitive proposals are raised advised
to make a “noisy withdrawal” and ask that it be minuted. If you stay, you may be
considered to have participated.

JR: what about the role of the chair in W3C?

TC: need to control any meetings that take place in the development of standards
to ensure they operate on an unrestricted basis. Ask the quiet person for their
point of view - there may be dissent that is unheard. If there is an objection,
a dispute resolution process is needed.

The focus should be technical. Is this proposal going to improve the outcome
should be the starting point, not opinion.

JR: in summary web standards are at the centre of antitrust enforcement today.

Definitions matter. If something is defined in an anitcompetitive manner that is
potentially very consequential.

Standards setting orgs must take great care in ensuring they follow legal
guidance. Current practices at the W3C do need more work.

We need a change – what worked in 1999 is not working today and will not work
tomorrow.

**Q&A**

DM: What should organisations be looking at when evaluating proposals that go
beyond the classic Internet standards field into the field of market design?

TC: as soon as you discuss big companies getting together to discuss the design
of markets raises alarm bells. The idea of designing arguments is antithetical
to the idea that markets are created by consumer demand. What is meant by
designing a market?

DM: I am thinking about the original way in which a banner ad is presented to a
users screen (through a real time auction which is a mechanism that needs to be
designed). Some of the proposals at W3C involve moving auctions and related
functionality into the web browser. Traditionally that hasn't been an issue but
when the browser is implementing the rules of a market it seems we are getting
into new territory. What does an organization have to do to work effectively
with these proposals?

TC: raises DOJ’s case against Google and the follow on damages actions. Market
design sounds like what is currently being prohibited as anti-competitive
activity. Doesn’t seem likely to be compliant. Anything that involves discussion
about markets and not technical outcomes should not be within the remit of a
standards making body. Market design seems out with the scope of the
organisation.

DM: what capabilities does the organisation need to build to be able to handle
such proposals?

TC: clear understanding of remit is essential. Absurd example: let’s fix the
price of advertising between Google/Apple. As Chair would reject such a
proposal. A market design proposal would similarly fall outside the scope of the
W3C.

Raises FPS. Proposal would have limited the beneficiaries to companies with
several domains. Chucked out by W3C.

JR: correction. Still under consideration.

TC: but initially rejected. Also picked up by the CMA in its privacy sandbox
monitoring as something which is discriminatory.

JR: points to an example of proposals which are being rejected as authorities as
anticomeptitive but not the W3C. W3C needs to step up its game in such matters.

TC: expresses that happy to record a similar presentation for the benefit of
members.
